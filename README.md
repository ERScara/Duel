# Duel – Win32/GDI Game Project
## Overview
This project is a fully functioning 2D space shooter game developed in Visual C++ using the Win32 API and GDI. It was created as a learning exercise and demonstrates how to build a complete interactive game from scratch in a low-level environment not typically designed for gaming.
Despite the limitations of GDI, the game runs smoothly, with working mechanics for movement, shooting, collisions, scoring, lives, and restart functionality. It is a testament to perseverance and creativity in programming.

## Storyline
Once loyal to the base, the fleet of identical ships has turned against their purpose. These rebel ships now seek to destroy the very stronghold they once served.
You are the last faithful pilot, the only one willing to defend the base at any cost. Armed with courage and determination, you must hold the line against waves of traitorous vessels, preventing them from overwhelming your defences.
Victory lies in your ability to survive, destroy the rebels, and protect the base from annihilation.

## Features
🚀 Player ship with responsive movement and boundary checks

🔫 Shooting mechanics with bullets that interact correctly with enemies.

👾 Enemy ships that move, fire back, and change direction dynamically.

💥 Collision detection between ships, bullets, and the player.

🎵 Sound effects for explosions and impacts.

🖥️ Restart button to reset the game state instantly.

📊 Score system rewarding successful hits.

## Technical Notes
Built entirely with Win32 API and GDI (no external libraries).
Implements event-driven logic via WM_TIMER and WM_COMMAND.
Uses transparent bitmaps for sprites and FillRect for backgrounds.
Demonstrates resource management and clean handling of graphics objects.

## How to Play
- Use the arrow keys to move your ship.

- Fire bullets to destroy rebel ships.

- Avoid enemy fire and collisions.

- Defend the base for as long as possible.

## Credits
Developed by Esteban, a Biotechnology student exploring programming and game development. This project was completed in just a few days as a personal milestone, proving that determination and curiosity can overcome technical barriers.
